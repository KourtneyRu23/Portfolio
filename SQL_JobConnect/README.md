# SQL_JobConnect

## Overview

The SQL_JobConnect project revolves around the development and management of a database for a theoretical platform called JobConnect. JobConnect serves as a crucial intermediary, connecting job seekers with prospective employers. The primary focus of this project is to design, create, and enhance the database that underpins the functionalities of the JobConnect platform.

### 1. SQL of Theoretical Project
In this phase, the project involves creating the initial database for JobConnect. This includes the design of the database schema, defining tables, and establishing relationships to provide a robust foundation for the platform.

### 2. Theory Project - Constraint
The Constraint section concentrates on refining the database by introducing constraints. Constraints play a vital role in maintaining data integrity by enforcing rules on the relationships between tables. This part is designed to implement these constraints, ensuring that the data stored in the database adheres to predefined rules.

### 3. Theory Project - Queries
In the Queries section, the project emphasizes the extraction of information from the JobConnect database using SQL queries. These queries are crafted to retrieve relevant data for analysis and reporting purposes. 

## Purpose
The goal of the SQL_JobConnect project is to create a robust and efficient database infrastructure that supports the seamless interaction between job seekers and employers. The platform aims to enhance the overall job-seeking and hiring experience by providing a well-organized and optimized database that facilitates effective matching and connectivity.
